##### Using **_Streamlit_**, **_Numpy_**, **_NLTk_**, and **_RE_** **_Python_** libraries our project can:

* Index a given set of questions and answers to build a mini search-engine using one of the following models:
    * Boolean Model
    * Extended Boolean Model
    * Vector Space (TF-IDF) Model

* Answer a query (Boolean query, Normal query) about the given questions and answers or about COVID-19 using
our pre-trained Models about COVID-19 questions.  

To install _Streamlit_ alone:  
`pip install streamlit`  

To install  the requirements:  
'pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt'  

Use `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` to run the project on http://localhost:8501
