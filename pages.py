        ##### Using **_Streamlit_**, **_NLTk_**, and **_RE_** **_Python_** libraries our project can:
        
        * Index a given set of questions and answers to build a mini search-engine using one of the following models:
            * Boolean Model
            * Extended Boolean Model
            * Vector Space (TF-IDF) Model

        * Answer a query (Boolean query, Normal query) about the given questions and answers or about COVID-19 using
        our pre-trained Models about COVID-19 questions.
        
        * **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a page from the dropdown on the left** to choose what to do!  
            * **Intro**: Current page  
            * **Upload**: To upload Q & A files  
            * **Query Input**: Search the uploaded questions  
            * **COVID-19 Query**: Ask a question about COVID-19
